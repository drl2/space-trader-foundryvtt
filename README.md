# Space Trader for Foundry VTT - Preliminary Release
A module to automate aspects of trading using the Mongoose Traveller 2nd Edition (2022 Core Rulebook Update) rules in the TwoDSix system.

## What's Implemented
This initial release implements passenger availabilty, standard freight, and mail.  It's being made available for testing and feedback.

## What's Coming
Speculative trading - both the buying and selling sides - are in progress and will be added before the full 1.0 release.

## License
Released under the very precisely defined "Mongoose told me on their forum to go ahead for now but they reserve the right to change their mind" license.  For this reason there's a non-trivial likelihood that Foundry won't add it to their official module list, and of course if Mongoose ever slaps my hand and says "Stop that!", I'll have to take it offline.  (Foundry doesn't appear to be on their radar at all in terms of official support, so it's unlikely to directly compete with anything of theirs.)

## Support
Questions, suggestions, and feedback can be directed to @drl2 on the [Foundry TwoDSix Discord](https://discord.gg/5Qx2ACQQgP).  (Note that I'm not affiliated with site or its admins at all.)
